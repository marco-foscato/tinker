# Source forlder for ICCGLFSE
This folder is meant to host the source code of the ICCGLFSE tool to be integrated in Tinker. The code is distributed by Prof. Rob J. Deeth - University of Warwick,
 Inorganic Computational Chemistry Group (ICCG).

## Compilation
To compile the sole ICCGLFSE tool, you have to edit the `Makefile` to define the environment (towards the beginning of the file) and then do `make all`. Otherwise, if you want to compile the integrated version of TinkerLFMM, please refer to [the parent README file](../README.md).
