# Source forlder for ICCGLFSE
This folder is meant to host the source code of the ICCGLFSE tool to be integrated in Tinker. However, the cose is not yet included in this repository. You must obtain the source code of the ICCGLFSE toom (ex-Dommino) from Prof. Rob J. Deeth - University of Warwick, Inorganic Computational Chemistry Group (ICCG).

## Compilation
To compile only the ICCGLFSE tool, you have to edit the `Makefile` to define the environment (towards the beginning of the file) and then do `make all`. Otherwise, if you want to compile the integrated version of TinkerLFMM, please refer to [the parent README file](../README.md).
